PSEUDOCODE
PRINTâ€“ input the numbers separated by a white space
Create a VARIABLE preferably a list that holds the inputs from the user
#use a for loop to go through the elements in the list
FOR the Element in the VARIABLE:
	Element * Element
	Append the squared elements to another NEWVARIABLE that will hold the squared elements
# use a while loop to sum the squared elements
Total = 0
WHILE elements < length of NEWVARIABLES
	Total = total + NEWVARIABLES[elements]
	Elements += 1

PRINT the total variable
